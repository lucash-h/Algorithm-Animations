Algorithms TODO
    - Insertion Sort
    - Machine Learning algorithms could be cool
        - Grad Desc
        - Simple neuron or nn depiction of back propagation 
        - other like random forest, clustering or SVM
    - Search algorithms could be cool, A* or djiktra(or however its spelled)
GENERAL TODO
    - Add a common interface, at least global variables to easily change settings for algorithm, a web interface running on a server would be kinda awesome. 
    - Documentation for the algorithm files in both readme and actual files
    - Check
